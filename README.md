# robot-arm
The goal of this project was to create a robot arm that could scan its immediate environment, identify cube-shaped objects using an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, and then stack them in order of decreasing size. An Arduino Uno with a custom shield was used to control and power the electronics.

The project was subsequently re-purposed for a computer vision application whereby the Ultrasonic Sensor was substituted for an Intel D435 Depth Camera. The main objective remained the same: stacking objects. However, the approach shifted to using fiducial marker detection to identify and classify the cube-shaped objects.
